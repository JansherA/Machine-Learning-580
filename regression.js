/*
I used these two youtube videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Lsfu4ab74
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cXuvTQl090
for the majority of the javascript (which I'm not good at), and then added CSS for a background image of Choate (which isn't very practical but I couldn't
get the strokes to stop repeating with a regular background color regardless, so might as well make it look nice). I also changed some colors in
javasript. If I had more time on this project, I would probably try to create a visual coordinate plane and have an input field for exact numbers so that
the program could actually be useful, but I couldn't get that to work yet.
